# Battleship
Battleship game coded in Python

This is my first full Python project. I started with the mini Battleship game challenge in the codeacademy.com tutorial.
The challenge was fun, so I decided to code the whole game. Apopogies for the rudamentary player interface. 
The game itself is true to Battleship though.

Check it out!
